# svm-openset-upgrade
Upgrading tboult's version of libsvm from 3.1 to 3.2, then modifiying his algorithms.

We have libsvm 3.10, and Dr. Boult's files; we will diff them and make the neccessary changes, then diff our "improved" 3.10 with 3.20, and make the neccessary changes there. Then we will change the algorithm in 3.20 to work with Dr. Boult's open set proposal.
